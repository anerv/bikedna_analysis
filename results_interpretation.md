# Results & interpretation

## GeoDanmark

**Correlation between infra length and comp gaps**

Longer network --> more gaps (obviously)
BUT - also outliers.

Notedly - Copenhagen and Odense have few gaps per km of bicycle infra and Aarhus has many.

**Correlation between infra length and topo errors**

Some correlation between length and errors - but also many municipalities, across a wide range of infra lengths, which have none.

Looking only at those munis with gaps, CPH again has few compared to length and Aarhus again has many.

**Correlation between infra length and no components**

Similar pattern as comp gaps - positive correlation but both high and low outliers.
Again Cph low and Aarhus high.

Looking at muni size as a third variable here, it does not seem to be good explanaition - small munis seem to be low both in infra length and number of comps, but there are muni with large areas and roughly same number of comps, but very different lengths of infra.
Also middle munis with medium networks and quite different number of comps.

**Correlation between muni size and no components**

Positive relationship but muddy.
Aarhus agian outlier in terms of number of comps - partly explained by size of network, but not completely?
Viborg and Ringkj√∏bing-Skjern outliers in terms of low number of comps and size. For RS maybe partly explained by small-ish network - not the case for Viborg (also somewhat outlier in other plots).

**Correlation between infra dens and no components**

Infra density cannot really explain number of components.

Some munis follow expected pattern:
Copenhagen and suburbs to the north stand out with high dens and few components (expected).

Aarhus has low density and many components - expected/what one would predict, *but* many other low density munis have way fewer components.

For some, this might however be because they both are small in terms of area and size.

## OSM

**Correlation between infra length and comp gaps**

Positive correlation
Much more clear/clean than GeoDK
Way fewer gaps
Aarhus has way more gaps than others - but this time more justified by network length
Cph a bit lower than expected from length of network

**Correlation between infra length and topo errors**

Some corr between length and errors. Also here many without one.
Aarhus also here has many errors - but this time aligns with network lenght.
Fredensborg has many errors compared to network length.

**Correlation between infra length and no components**

Clear positive correlation.

Aarhus again has many comp - but also large network.
Copenhagen has fewer components than expected from size - but possibly explained by small area.

Although not perfectly aligned with size, smaller areas tend to have smaller networks and fewer components, opposite for larger.

**Correlation between muni size and no components**

Some positive correlation - but very wide span.
Larger munis -- more comp.
Aarhus outlier - many comp compared to size - but also very big network.

**Correlation between infra dens and no components**

Look somewhat similar to plot for GeoDK.
No low density munis with many components, but for low density munis, both some with many and few components - probably partially explained by infra length.
